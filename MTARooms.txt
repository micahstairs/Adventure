Introduction
Your name is Wilah Fistairs and you just woke up from a very uncomfortable night's sleep. You
realize that you have a massive hangover. Your shirt is covered in vomit and you're in a bathroom
stall at Ducky's, which is Mount Allison's favorite student pub. You don't remember much of your
past night's experience, but you do remember the cute brunette girl who asked you to come party
with her while you were working on your computer science homework. Unable to decline to her offer
(as this is a very rare opportunity for a nerdy CS student) you pack your things and head out with
her in the night. Laying in the very gloomy, desolate and dirty stall you realize you have lost your
homework and that it needs to be handed in to Dr. Ricker before noon or else you lose 135% of your
grade. Pumped with adrenalin and the determination to find your homework, you stumble out of Ducky's,
trying to remember every last scrap of information that you can...

A mystical aura surrounds the deranged, ominous metal figure. You find a secret storage space behind
the miniature house, revealing a stash of alcoholic beverages. A door entrance to the NORTH leads you

Swan Pond Adventure
... a few minutes have passed and you are laying face-first on the ground with your shorts
thickened in black morass. You've come to conclusion that you are covered in swan feces since you
are at the swan pond. Being a heavy alcoholic, you got very excited when discovering a hidden stash
of liquor and could not resist chugging an entire bottle, resulting in passing out soon afterwards.
You make your way to the Music Conservatory to clean up.

In front of R.P. Bell Library
You stand in front of a very large, imposing and aged library. To your EAST in the
middle of a breeze-way stands a very peculiar metal structure. This catches your
attention and reminds you of the houses in Harry Potter. To the WEST stands the arts
building. To the NORTH is a clearing which is surrounded by a number of buildings. You also
notice that the doors to the library are unlocked allowing you to go IN the library. Looking DOWN
the hill, you see Ducky's in the distance. You probably should stay clear of there until you've
located your homework. You see a path leading SOUTHWEST to the student centre.

As you step into the arts building you recall that the brunette you were with
was an arts student and that you ventured in there with her for a little while as
she showed you her paintings and statues. A staircase leads UP the stairs to the 
room with canvas paintings. To the RIGHT is the room filled with marble statues and 
clay vessels. Looking out the door, you can either head towards the chapel, which is
found to your NORTH, or towards a cluster of buildings by the library, which is EAST. 
Directly SOUTH you see the Student centre looming in the distance.

You gently push the closest clay vessel to you within proximity. It unleashes a massive,
unstoppable domino effect, which smashes every vessel in the room and knocks over all the
statues. The largest of the statues is a statue of Poseidon, which falls towards you.
Poseidon's trident penetrates your internal organs and you fall backwards and plummet into
an assembly of vessel fragments immobilizing you as you bleed to death.

As your heart sinks, she asks a question, "What do you have in your hands?". Looking down at the
laptop in your hands and immediately realize what she is referring to. Somehow, you must've cracked
her computer screen during your extensive and desperate search for your handwork. Accepting your
fate, and realizing that you will surely be re-doing the course again next semester, you abruptly
leave, curl up into a ball, and cry. It is not long after that Dr. Ricker finds you and tells you
that you were, in fact, a person who won the optional contest, got the highest mark in class, and
also scored a full 5% on the Flappi Byrd bonus assignment.  She then congratulates you for being a
remarkable student and tells you that her screen had already been broken before it got lost. You are
relieved that your search was not in vain and everything turned out better than you could have ever
foreseen. Best of all... you passed the course!
